> **Summary:**  
> This work tackled one of the hardest problems in medical imaging — **cross-tumor generalization**.
> 
> I led the development of a **multi-model ensemble pipeline** that segments brain tumors across five distinct tumor types, even without knowing the tumor category in advance.  
>
> Our key innovations — **pseudo-label bootstrapping**, **ratio-adaptive postprocessing**, and **TumorSurfer multitask anatomy learning** — together improved robustness across tumor types and demographics, earning **1st place worldwide** at the *MICCAI 2025 BraTS GoAT Challenge*.

> **Summary:**  
> At Columbia’s **ROAM Lab**, I contributed to **ChatEMG**, a framework that generates **synthetic electromyography (EMG)** data to train models controlling a **robotic hand orthosis** for stroke rehabilitation.  
>  
> The project demonstrated how **language-conditioned generative models** can synthesize realistic biosignals for downstream control tasks — **reducing dependence on limited patient data** and enabling more **data-efficient training** of assistive robotic systems.
